Hi! We're Joe, Michael, Jessica, and Dave from Pill Popping Doctors. We grew up together in the Seattle area right
    when grunge rock took over. In middle school, we saved up money to buy guitars and amps and would play every day in
    Michael's garage until his parents got angry calls from the neighbors. After high school we all went our separate
ways but realized that college wasn't for us, so we started hanging out and playing music again. Eventually we started
playing at local bars and taverns. Check out our blog to follow us on our journey!
